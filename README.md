# word-anagram
This program is a simple word anagram game where the player must unscramble randomly selected words.
Words are loaded from a file, filtered by length, scrambled, and presented to the player. Correct guesses earn points based on word length, with consecutive correct answers increasing the total score. The game ends when the player quits.

## setup instructions
1. Make sure Python is installed and that wordlist.txt is in the same directory.
2. Run using: python3 word_anagram.py
